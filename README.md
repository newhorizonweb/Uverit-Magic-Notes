# Uverit Magic Notes

Uverit Magic Notes - Sync your thoughts, organize your tasks, and stay on top of to-dos on all devices.

Leave quick notes on any webpage and keep everything in sync wherever you go.
It’s a handy way to stay organized and remember important stuff!

## Notes Area

Here's the place where all the magic happens!

You can type whatever you want:
Quick thought about a video you just watched?
Replacement for an ingredient on a recipe page?
Important date on a Wikipedia page?
And all done!

Everything you enter is private, no one can see your notes.
Your notes are synchronized across every device you have your account logged into.
That way, you can effortlessly save something on your PC at home and access it later on a laptop in your favorite, quiet café around the corner!

After you're done, you can just delete the note.
It will also disappear from the saved notes list.
